# class Grain:

    # Make a separate layer of one gray color
    
    # Apply white noise onto this gray layer (50% noise)
    # Gaussian distribution so they're randomly spaced

    # Set the noise size larger so we can actually see it

    # Finally blur the noise layer because grain doesn't have sharp edges

    # Merge the two

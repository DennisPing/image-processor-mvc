# image-processor-mvc
A python implementation of a basic image processing program.

The point of this project is to learn Python by redo-ing my old Java homework. This old homework is a complete MVC program that can edit images.

## My goals for this project:
1. To implement an Image Processing MVC program using Python and popular modules:
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - Pillow
2. To learn Python specific design patterns
3. To practice general design patterns
4. To learn PyQT5

## What this project is not:
1. Concise, efficient code - I purposely chose to do tasks manually in order to practice Python fundamentals.
2. Pure object oriented programming - Python gives me some flexibility
3. Pure functional programming - I still want to practice OOP if applicable

## Features that are working:
- [x] Blur
- [x] Sharpen
- [x] Greyscale
- [x] Sepia
- [x] Mosaic
- [x] Pixelate
- [x] Dither (slow version)

## To-do
- [ ] Controller
- [ ] View
- [ ] Testing with PyTest
